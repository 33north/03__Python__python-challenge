03 Python Homework

For this challenge, two sets of data were analyzed.

The first was financial data of a company in the PyBank challenge.  We read in the budget_data.csv and looked through the data to find total months, net total amount, the average change from month to month (profit and losses), and finding the month and year with the greatest profit and the month and year with the greatest loss.

Necessary files:
<li>budget_data.csv<li>
<li>financial_analysis.txt (output file)<li>
<li>main.py (PyBank) script<li>
