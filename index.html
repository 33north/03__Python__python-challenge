  <p>
    For this challenge, two sets of data were analyzed.

    The first is financial data of a company in the PyBank challenge. We read in the budget_data.csv and looked through the data to find total months, net total amount, the average change from month to month (profit and losses), and finding the month and year with the greatest profit and the month and year with the greatest loss.

    Necessary files:

      budget_data.csv
      financial_analysis.txt output file
      main.py (PyBank) script file

    The second is election and voting data for a small rural town in PyPoll challenge. We analyzed election_data.csv found the total votes cast, the candidates in the election, and the total votes and percentage of votes each candidate received. In the end, determined the winner of the election.

    Necessary files:
    <ul>
      <li>election_data.csv</li>
      <li>election_results.txt output file</li>
      <li>main.py (PyPoll) script file</li>
  </ul>
